Welcome to my portfolio, here you'll find all the projects I've been working on since April 2021. 

- Portfolio index:
    
        1 - My first projects in R --> Here the first projects I ever developed in R can be found. 

        2 -  My first projects in Python --> Applying financial concepts with python.  

        3 -  Vectorization with R and Python --> Vectorization approach of coding both in R and Python.
        
        4 -  Markowitz with 70k assets --> Solving the markowitz frontier using 70k investment funds. 

        5 -  Genetic Algorithm using markowitz --> Solving the markowitz frontier using a Genetic Algorithm.

        6 -  Creating a synthetic benchmark --> Creating a synhtetic benchmark based on the "Any Monkey Can Beat The Market" theory.

        7 -  Portfolio Optimiazation --> Optimizing portfolio strategies using CVXPY. 

        8 -  Machine Learning --> Solving a single and multilable classification problem using different ML algorithms. 

        9 -  Dense Neural Networks --> Development of models using Dense neural networks. 

        10 -  Convultional + Recurrent NN --> Solving famous datasets using CNN and applying CNN and RNN with financial data. 

        11 -  PCA + AUTOENCODERS --> First steps towards GANs. Performing PCAs and developing autoencoders using DNN and CNN.

- Each folder contains:

        a) The necessary data to execute all codes. Please be aware that the directory data paths might need to be changed within the code.

        b) A README.md file with the project's explanation. 

- Currently developing three projects involving (ETA 3-5 weeks):

        a) Natural Lenguage Processing.

        b) Generative Adversarial Networks.

        c) Master's thesis involving a trading algorithm using deep learning and portfolio optimization techniques. (ETA June 2022)
